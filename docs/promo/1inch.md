# Why do you want to contribute to the 1inch Network? *

Our network contains more than 1000 whitelabel wallets builded by our tool which has been used by more than 1000 developers to build their projects (landing page + online cryptowallet ). 200 of them pay us for this tool https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064, 400 use free version https://wordpress.org/plugins/multi-currency-wallet/ .  Our client is newbie web developer or "no-code" or "low-code" developer who want to build cryptoproject without coding skills. Some of this developers has own community and want to provide a crypto product to his comunity. 10 of them asked eth-erc20 exchange, 4 of them asked visa to erc20 (literaly sell tokens to his users using credit card), 1 pays 1000$ to get visa to erc20 bridge (and another onу want to pay also but waiting for demo). We planned to use the 1inch Network as a backend (using your api) which solves this problem for our clients and users.


# Select the category *
Network development: Integrations that help increase the usage of 1inch products and development of technologies beneficial to the 1inch Network.
Community development: Enabling teams and individuals to strengthen the 1inch Network through education, events and social outlets.
Research and analytics: Projects that provide key insights vital for the 1inch Network’s growth, competitiveness and product/market fit.

Network development - our case.


# Describe your proposal in one sentence: *

Integrate 1inch Pathfinder and Limit Orders Protocol into the crypto wordpress wallet installed on 1000+ sites to provide eth-to-erc20 exchange feature. 

### More details

By default our wallet proveid atomic swap exchange between different blockchains. We have partnership agrrrement with litecoin, bitcoin cash, ghost by McAfee, Next chain. For now we can offer only this type of service. But most of our payable clients need fast exchange only on the one network - ETH or BSC. We believe 1inch provides some of the best and most available services in this area. 

Usecases for different types of users:

- Native JS Developers. we are open source project and anyone can fork our project on github for their own needs. Like the client plugin, they have their own users.
- WordpDpress plugin users.  who wants to make own brand/product. He will install our plugin on his domain
and customize plugin as he wants. The main difference in this case is that he will have its own users.
- usual user who wants to exchange his assets. He will open our or any other application from our customers and can make fast exchange on the available chains through 1inch Network. Also if he wants to create an order with special price it also will be available with Limit Orders Protocol. At this time we know about 40000 wallets who generated adresses using our network. 

All of this significantly increases the number of users our product. Afterwards it will subsequently increase the number of users of 1inch Network.

# Tell us more about your project *
What problem does it solve? How will it succeed? In what ways will it help strengthen and grow out the 1inch Network?

SwapOnline is open sourse non-custodial multi-currency wallet with decentralized exchange based on atomic swap. We distribute our code using github and WordpRess platform (more platforms such Cloudflare Apps are soon). Now we sell our wallet as plugin for wordpress platform and at this moment it is top 1 simplest cryptocurrency wallet widget on codecanyon and pugins.woprdpress.com. Our mission is to simplify the introduction of new users and developers in the blockchain ecosystems without developer skills.

### "What problem does it solve?"
10 times developers asked us about eth-erc20 exchange, 4 of them asked visa to erc20 (literaly sell tokens to his users using credit card), 1 pad 1000$ to get visa-to-erc20 bridge (and another onу want to pay also but waiting for demo). 

### "How will it succeed?"
A lot of new developers will use or tool not only to build own wallet but also deliver new "crypto" exchange, defi and other crypto stuff to their communities under own brand.  

### "In what ways will it help strengthen and grow out the 1inch Network?"
More and more developers are using our tools we planned to port the code to another platforms, marktplaces such as cloudflare apps, amazon marketplace etc. More ways, more developers in our network and more final users will use exchange.

# In what ways does your project stand out from the competition? *

We focused on low-code developers. Our clients are developers who add our wallet as additional functionality on their platforms,
one of our clients is GHOST by McAfee, NEXT.coin etc., you can find more our clients here (https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/blob/master/docs/CLIENTS.md).


# What level of support do you expect throughout the project completion process? *

we will use your API, we expect you will fix the bugs and add simple functions (such as callback after success payment). Best if you can provie "visa-to-customerc20" api endpoint. But current API methods is enough. 

# What is your estimated timeline (with milestones) for completion of the project? *
There no deadline, we will add eth-to-erc exchange ASAP, we planned to deliver all your new stuff (NFTs, DeFi etc.) to clients using our own network. 

# What stage do you expect to be the most challenging?
Long-term sustainability. By default we can add your api easily, but we made tons of changes every day based on feedback from our clients, we should not only do "simplest" integration but deliver better user experience. For example our clients pay us to provide VISA to ERC20 token bridge, it's more than just add "call api method using web3 or https" but required complex work of designer, developer, manager and client.

# What is the size of funding you expect for completing each milestone of the project? *
Milestones (all milestones inlcude 2 year support and improvements): 
1. simple API connection (beta), work with real customer who really want it to finalize beta version. (70 000)
2. improve UX (provide visa-to-erc bridge), develop dashboards, metrics and so on (70 000)
3. expand network to new platforms such cloudflare apps, amazon marketplace, heroku etc.. (100 000)
4. integrate other stuff 1inch team will develop (70 000)

This funds required to solve HR issues (finding devs, educating and motivation the old developers) for two years. 

# How will the project be maintained upon completion of the grant? Will any external sources of funding be available to ensure long-term sustainability? *
We propose to create a multisig fund which will use only with reporting by human-hours (we use monitask.com to track) and specific github issue related to 1inch, exchange UI and so on.  Also our clients pay us to get the workable application so we will mainteined this as long as our clients will need this.
