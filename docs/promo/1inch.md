# Why do you want to contribute to the 1inch Network? *

Our wallet has been installed by more than 1000 developers, it is used over 40,000 users from all the world
and many of these users want the eth-erc20 exchange option.
We want to use the 1inch Network as a backend which solves this problem for our clients and users.


# Select the category *
Network development: Integrations that help increase the usage of 1inch products and development of technologies beneficial to the 1inch Network.
Community development: Enabling teams and individuals to strengthen the 1inch Network through education, events and social outlets.
Research and analytics: Projects that provide key insights vital for the 1inch Networkâ€™s growth, competitiveness and product/market fit.

Network development - our case.


# Describe your proposal in one sentence: *

Integrate 1inch Pathfinder and Limit Orders Protocol into the crypto wordpress wallet installed on 1000+ sites.

### More details

Not for everyone need such a type of technology as atomic swap (secure, but slow) or exchanges between
different blockchains. For now we can offer only this type of service. Some of our
clients need fast exchange only on the one blockchain network. We believe 1inch
provides some of the best and most available services in this area. Examples for
different types of users:

- usual user who wants to exchange his assets. He will open our or any other application from our customers and can make fast exchange on the available chains through 1inch Network. Also if he wants to create an order with special price it also will be available with Limit Orders Protocol.

- plugin client who wants to make own brand/product. He will install our plugin on his domain
and customize plugin as he wants. The main difference in this case is that he will have its own users.

- developers, we are open source project and anyone can fork our project on github for their own needs. Like the client plugin, they have their own users.

All of this significantly increases the number of users our product. Afterwards it will subsequently increase the number of users of 1inch Network.

# Tell us more about your project *
What problem does it solve? How will it succeed? In what ways will it help strengthen and grow out the 1inch Network?

SwapOnline is open sourse non-custodial multi-currency wallet with decentralized exchange based on atomic swap, also we provide our wallet as plugin for wordpress platform and at this moment it is top 1 simplest cryptocurrency wallet widget on codecanyon. Our mission is to simplify the introduction of new users and developers in the blockchain ecosystems without developer skills.

### "What problem does it solve?"
Anyone can create a popular blockchain wallets and exchange their own assets between blockchains using smart contracts,
without using intermediaries in the form of centralized exchanges.

### "How will it succeed?"
It succeed out when we connect even more blockchains for swaps and more users know about our wallet.

### "In what ways will it help strengthen and grow out the 1inch Network?"
We integrate the 1inch Network in our wallet and all our users will use it to exchange any ERC20 tokens to ETH and vice versa.


# In what ways does your project stand out from the competition? *

One of the main differences is mainly our clients are developers who add our wallet as additional functionality on their platforms,
one of our clients is GHOST by McAfee, SONM, NEXT.coin etc., you can find more our clients here (https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/blob/master/docs/CLIENTS.md).


# What level of support do you expect throughout the project completion process? *

we will use your API, we expect you will fix the bugs and add simple functions (such as callback after success payment)

# What is your estimated timeline (with milestones) for completion of the project? *
2 month

# What stage do you expect to be the most challenging?
Long-term sustainability, we can add your api easily, but we made tons of changes every day after feedback of our clients, we should not only do "simplest" integration but deliver better user experience. For example our clients pay us to provide VISA to ERC20 token bridge, it's more than just add "call api method using web3" but required complex work of designer, developer, manager and client.

# What is the size of funding you expect for completing each milestone of the project? *
200 000 $ . To solve HR issues (finding devs, educating and motivation the old developers) for tho years. But we can start with 0$

# How will the project be maintained upon completion of the grant? Will any external sources of funding be available to ensure long-term sustainability? *
Our clients pay us to get the workable application so we will mainteined this as long as our clients will need this.
