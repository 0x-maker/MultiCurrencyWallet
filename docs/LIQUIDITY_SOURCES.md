# How to add your own token

The main steps you need to follow so that other people can exchange your own token:

1. use https://vittominacori.github.io/erc20-generator/ to create erc20 token if you don't have it yet. We recomend to select BSC network there. 
2. add pool to one of this DEXes or create "limit order" 

## Supported liquidity sources

### Ethereum

- https://app.uniswap.org (recommend)
- https://app.sushi.com
- https://mooniswap.exchange
- https://dmm.exchange
- https://dodoex.io
- https://curve.fi

### Binance Smart Chain

We recommend using this network due to the low gas price ($0.01 - 0.5 instead of $20-200 on eth mainnet). If your token is on Ethereum, you may use the bridge to move part of the total supply of tokens using  https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge (select ETH - BSC bridge)
