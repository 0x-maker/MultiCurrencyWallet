# How to add your own token

The main steps you need to follow so that other people can exchange your own token:

1. use https://vittominacori.github.io/erc20-generator/ to create erc20 token if you don't have it yet. We recomend to select BSC network there. 
2. add pool to one of this DEXes or create "limit order"
